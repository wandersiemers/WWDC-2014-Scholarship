Time Out is the first app I shipped that wasn't client work. I was unsatisfied with the Dribbble clients that launched after iOS 7 shipped, so I decided to write my own. It gave me invaluable experience in designing and building an app from scratch, starting by thinking how the user should feel when using the app, then deciding which features were important and which weren't, and continuing until I had something I was proud of. It was a lot of work but I learned so much from it. In the process, I had some fun with new iOS 7 APIs like Background Fetch, UIKit Dynamics, and the View Controller transitioning APIs. I open-sourced parts of it that I found hard to implement because I think giving back to the community is very important since I myself learnt everything from the community.

Time Out is available on the App Store.
