This past October, I was selected to attend the Tech Talks in London. I live in Amsterdam, so London wasn't too far away, and I could just take a train and be there within four hours. It was great fun being in London around Christmas, but meeting all these like-minded developers and Apple engineers was even better. I met a few people whom I still talk to today, which is great since it can be difficult to meet other developers if you're still relatively new to the community, especially when you're only fifteen years old. It was very cool to be able to talk to Apple engineers; I was able to solve a few issues I'd had with UIKit, got Time Out evaluated by Apple's UI designers, and could chat about cool things with the evangelists.
