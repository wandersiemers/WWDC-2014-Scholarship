Last September, I interned at Q42 in Amsterdam. They develop all the software for Philips' Hue smart lightbulbs, write websites for big organizations like the Rijksmuseum (the most important museum in The Netherlands), the Staatsloterij (the biggest lottery in Holland), and have developed the software for a new initiative called O4NT (education for a new era) which is a school system that tries to adjust education to the individual needs of children by giving each child an iPad with software that automatically tracks progress and adjusts to the child's skills and progress. I worked on their iOS SDK for Philips' Hue bulbs and wrote some cool effects like a Knight Rider moving lights effect that annoyed everybody in the office. The people at Q42 are simply amazing and very friendly. They even have a slide in their office which felt awkward but after my (extensive) testing turned out to actually be a pretty efficient way of getting downstairs. Interning there was so much fun that I'm planning to work there during the summer break.
