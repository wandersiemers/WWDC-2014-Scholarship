Hi there! I'm Wander. Apart from all the iOS stuff you've read about, I also do some other things. I was selected for an Honours program this year, which means I can use school hours to work on a project of my own. I've chosen to do a research project on compiler technology and assembly language. I'm also learning Ruby and Node.js at the moment, and I know HTML/CSS. When I'm not coding, I love to make long biking trips on my racing bike. We have a little house in the forest some 40 miles from our home in Amsterdam and last summer, I went there by bike with a good friend of mine. The weather was great and it was one of the coolest things I did last year, though going to WWDC would definitely top that. I also like music a lot. I enjoy electronical music like Daft Punk, Deadmau5, Rudimental, C2C, Flume, but also like Hip Hop/Rap. Seeing Jay-Z in a big soccer stadium in Holland is definitely one of my best memories of last year.
