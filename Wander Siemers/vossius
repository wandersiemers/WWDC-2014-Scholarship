Vossius Open Dagen is an app my school asked me and a friend built for my school's Open Days this past January. When requesting permission to attend the iOS 7 Tech Talks, I told the principal about iOS Development, and they asked us to build an app that would replace the 300+ paper programs that they would print each year with minimal adjustments compared to previous years. They realized the paper programs were a waste of paper and that an app could easily replace them, so we built one, in two weeks from start to finish. It turned out later that the app was much more usable than the paper programs were and they needed less personnel: next year, they expect to be able to run the event with two fewer teachers. We're pretty proud that our app has actually made the event cheaper for our school while also improving the experience for the visitors.

Vossius Open Dagen is still available on the App Store.
